A NodeJS Raspberry Pi application used to collect weather data. This application uses the MEAN stack to accomplish the following:
MongoDB - log sensor data to a persistent database every 30 minutes
Express - serve the http interface and sensor APIs
Angular - render the sensor data (real-time and past 24 hours)
NodeJS - provide a server-side JavaScript environment

The Raspberry Pi for this project uses the following components:
DHT11 sensor - temperature and humidity
I2C 1602 LCD - display
BMP180 sensor - atmospheric pressure
Photoresistor - light sensing

To run: node server.js
To access web interface: http://[IP]:8000
